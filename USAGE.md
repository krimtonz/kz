## 1 Introduction
The main interface for kz, is used by bringing up the menu which by default is done by pressing the `R + L` Buttons.

The menu is navigated with the dpad buttons, and items are activated with the `L` button.

**Note:** On WiiVC the `L` Button is mapped to the `c-stick down` by default.

kz also implements the following features beyond the menu:
* An input viewer
* A lag counter
* A real-time timer
* Various commands.
* An inventory editor within the pause screen.

All of these are configurable in the [settings menu](#210-settings)

If when rebinding the activate menu command, you find yourself in a state where the menu cannot be activated, entering the konami code (up up down down left right left right B A) will reset ALL settings to their default values.

## 2 Menus
### 2.1 Warps
The warps menu contains a listing of all the entrances in the game categorized into 10 categories.  These categories are based on the central clock town area, the 4 cardinal directions of normal gameplay, overworld, and other miscellaneous scenes.  Under each category is a listing of scenes, if a scene has multiple entrances selecting that scene will enter a menu with all available entrances. Selecting an entrance will immediately warp you to that entrance.  If a scene only has one entrance, selecting that scene will warp you to that single entrance.

**Note:** The Beta category is only available in the 1.0 japanese version of the game.

**Note:** By default entrances that are known to crash are disabled, if kz was compiled with these entrances enabled, using these entrances will most likely crash.

***Warning:*** Warping while not in a normal playing state of the game (i.e. spinning n64 logo, file select screen) will cause *undefined beahvior*
### 2.2 Cheats
The cheats menu will allow you to enable/disable various cheats.

Arrows, bombs, bombchus, powder kegs, sticks, nuts, health, magic, and rupees will all enable infinite amounts of these items.

`no blast mask cooldown` will allow you to use the blast mask immediately after using it.

`no item restriction` will allow you to use any item as any form.
**Note:** The fierce diety mask is a special case.  While the cheat will work for this mask, the c button will still be dimmed out though it is usable.  Putting the mask on or off will cause the HUD to be faded out until a scene change occurs.

`isg` will keep link's sword in a swinging state mimicking the infinite sword glitch.  Disabling the cheat will not instantly stop isg, you must cancel using the normal isg cancellation methods.  
**Note:** while the cheat is enabled, the normal cancellations for isg will not work i.e non-targeted shielding.

`freeze time` will not allow the 3 day timer to progress.
### 2.3 Scene
The scene menu contains information about the currently loaded scene.
**current room** shows you which room is currently loaded.  If no room is currently loaded 255 will be displayed.  
**num rooms** shows you how many rooms are in the current scene.  
**unload room** will unload all rooms in the current scene.  
**load room** will load the room specified by the index next to the button, if the index is the currently loaded room, then the room is unloaded.  If the index is larger than the number of rooms in the scene, no action is taken.

#### 2.3.1 Collision
The collision menu will allow control over kz's collision viewer feature.  Enabling the collision viewer will draw polygons over the scene's collision.  Under the enable checkbox the collision viewer has these options:
* **reduce** When this option is enabled only special types of collision are displayed.  This will use less memory and cause less graphics lag.
* **opaque** When this option is enabled the polygons that are displayed will not be see through and will appear as solid colors.
* **wireframe** When this option is enabled lines will be drawn around each polygon.  **Note:** This option typically causes heavy lag.
* **autoupdate** When this option is enabled dynamic collision will also be displayed, also when a new scene is loaded the collision will be regenerated for the new scene.

The collision viewer uses these colors to identify special types of collision
* **blue** the surface is hookshotable
* **purple** the surface can be interacted with, such as ladders of vines
* **red** special void planes
* **cyan** loading zones
* **green** surfaces that can cause damage or slow link down
* **yellow** slippery slopes
* **white** normal collision 

The hide room option will prevent the game from rendering the currently loaded room.

The hitbox viewer will display the colliders, the opaque option is the same as it is for the collision viewer.  The hitbox viewer will display hitboxes with the following colors:

* **Red:** causes damage when collided with a blue hitbox.
* **Blue:** hitbox which can receive damage from a red hitbox
* **White:** a hitbox which does not cause damage, but is meant for bumping

The hide actors option will prevent actors from being rendered visually.

***Warning:*** Lite versions of kz are more prone to crashing when the collision and hitbox viewers are enabled without the **reduce** option enabled for larger scenes such as dungeons.

#### 2.3.2 Camera
The camera menu contains a few toggles for enabling kz's free camera.

**enable free cam**  
enable kz's free camera.

**lock free cam**  
this will release the button restrictions that are placed when the free camera is enabled, but keep the camera at the current free cam position.  
  
**set cam pos to link pos** this will move the free camera's position to links current position

#### Controlling the Free Camera
Using the control stick will rotate the camera.  
If holding **Z** the camera will roll when moving the control stick left or right.

**c-up** will move the camera forwards (zoom in)  
**c-down** will move the the camera backwards (zoom out)  
**c-right** will move the camera to the right (strafe right)  
**c-left** will move the camera to the left (strafe left)

When using the c buttons to move the camera, holding the **Z** button will move the camera faster.

## 2.4 States
The states menu will allow you to change the active savestate slot, create a name for your save state, and export and import states to the SD card.  See the [states section](#3-save-states) for more information on save states.

**Note**: sd card features are only enabled for the WiiVC version of kz.

**cur state** This will allow you to switch the change the active state. kz allows the saving of up to 5 states numbered from 0 to 4 use the **<** and **>** buttons to switch between them.  
**state name** underneath the **cur state** section there will be a name for the current state.  **no state** will be displayed if currently no state is saved in the selected state.  **untitled** will be displayed as the default name when a state is created in the selected slot for the first time.  Selecting the state name will bring up a keyboard to rename the state.  
**export** will allow you to export the currently saved state to the sd card  
**import** will allow you to select an exported state to import to the current selected slot.

### 2.5 Watches
The Watches menu provides a list of custom memory watches

Next to the id specifier is the the `push` button, when this button is hit, the object specified by the id specifier is pushed to the object context, and is loaded immediately.

Next to the push button is the `pop` button, when this button is hit, the last item in the object content is removed from the content, and that memory is freed.

***Warning:*** Pushing an object which needs more memory than is available in the game will cause a crash, and popping an object that is required will also cause a crash.

#### 2.9.3 Actors
The actors menu allows you to modify the currently loaded actors in the game.

Underneath the return button is the `type specifier` changing this value will change the actor address to the first actor of that type.  There are 16 different actor types, which the final 4 are unknown.

Underneath the type specifier are the `previous` and `next` buttons, hitting these buttons will change the actor address to the prevous actor of that type, or the next actor of that type respectively.  Hitting previous on the first actor of the current type will change the actor to the final actor of that type, while hitting next of the final actor of that type will change the actor to the first actor.

Underneath the previous and next buttons is the `actor address` button.  This will show the address of the currently selected actor.  Hitting this button will take you to the [memory editor](#291-memory) at that actor's address.

Press and hold the button combination to unbind a command.

## 3 Save States
Save states are implemented in a way which only saves information which is needed to reconstruct the state of the game when the state is created.  Because of this there are a few things that are not restored in the same state when the savestate was created.

* **Audio** Saving and restoring the entire audio state would greatly increase the size of states, therefore only parts of the audio system are saved to restore the audio to a functional state.  The correct sequences will be played, however they will not be restored to the same time in the sequence the state was saved at.  If a state is saved while audio is transitioning from one volume to another, the volume will be restored at the final volume level.
* **pause screen** The background image of the pause screen is not saved in the save state therefore if a state is saved from the pause screen and then loaded after another pause has been done, the most recent pause screen background will be displayed.
* **ace/srm** any locations in memory that are edited by these or other similiar glitches are not guaranteed to be saved in the save state.

## 4 Lite Version
The lite version of kz, allows most of the kz features to be used on systems that cannot take advantage of expanded memory space such as the N64, WiiUVC, and standard n64 emulators.

Because kz-lite must be placed in a much smaller memory area, features had to be elimiated in order to make this viable.  The [debug menu](#29-debug) is removed completely.

SD Features are not implemented in lite versions.

Item icons that are normally displayed in the [inventory menu](#26-inventory) are replaced with check boxes to enable/disable those items.  A tooltip is provided so which item is being switched is known.

***Warning:*** Because of the limited amount of memory available to the lite version, crashes may be more likely.  The `collision viewer` in particular should be used with care.

## 5 Commands
kz implements the following commands
* toggle menu - opens or closes the main menu
* return - returns to the previous menu
* levitate - classic "L to levitate" causes links to rise when held
* turbo - Increases link's linear velocity

* load position - set's link's position to the position saved in the current slot
* next position - moves to the next position slot
* prev position - moves to the previous position slot

## 6 Keyboard
kz implements an on screen keyboard for easy text editing.  There are a few shortcuts to make editing a bit faster.

While holding `R`:
* `D-Left` : Backspace
* `D-Right` : space
* `D-Up` : Caps-Lock
* `D-Down` : Accept

## 7 SD Features
kz is able to communicate with the SD Card in the WiiVC Version.

When a feature is used that needs the sd card, a files menu will pop up.

Underneath the return button is the `reset disk` button.  If the SD Card is removed and reinserted or another sd card is used, this button will reset the state of the sd card and reload the current files on the disk.

Underneath the reset disk button displays the current directory.

When saving a file underneath the current directory is the filename input button.  When the button is clicked the [keyboard](#6-keyboard) is brought up to name the file.

When saving a file underneath the filename input button is the `accept` button.  Hitting this button will accept the new file name and return to the previous menu.  Next to the accept button is the `clear` button.  Hitting this button will clear out the filename.

When saving a file, there is a `create new folder` in the file list indicated by a folder icon with a `+`, pressing this button will bring up a keyboard to create a new folder in the current directory.

A normal file is indicated by a page icon next to the file name.  When saving a file and the file name is hit, the filename is set to that filename.  When loading a file and the filename is hit, that file is the file loaded.

A directory is indicated by a folder icon next to the file name.  Hitting the directory name will switch to that directory.

## 8 Memfiles

memfiles are a sort of psuedo-savestate.  They are much simpler than true save states, but still allow for powerful practice.

A memfile saves the entirety of the save context, as well as some other information needed for restoring that save context.

When a memfile is loaded in the same scene that the memfile was saved from, no action is taken.

## 9 Frame Advancing
When the game is paused using the `pause` or `advance` commands, the game will stop frame execution at this point.  Use the `advance` command to advance to the next frame.  When the `advance` command is used when the game is not currently paused, the resulting action is the same as if you used the `pause` command.

## 10 Pause Screen Editor
Holding the `L` Button (`c-stick-down` on VC) while in the pause screen will enable inventory editing.  When this mode is enabled a red `i` will be shown in the lower right corner of the screen.  This mode will allow you to move the cursor into any item or mask slot in order to select an item to place in that slot.  When on the `Quest Status` subscreen, selecting each item in the menu with the `L` button will toggle that item as obtained or not.
